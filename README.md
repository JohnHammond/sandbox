General Information
-------------

This repository houses all the material, documentation and code for the 2018 Electrical Engineering Capstone project that was assigned to 1/c Brandon Ledford and 1/c John Hammond. 

The project is advertised as an __IT/OT Cyber Range in a Box__. 

To be more verbose, the official title is the ___Rapid Deployment and Provisioning of a Cyber Training Ground & IT/OT Testbed___. For colloquial use, the project and ultimately the resulting tool is codenamed __Sandbox__ .

* __Need:__ 
 
    _The ability to learn and test cyber skills is an important need for CGCYBER and USCGA. Utilizing a commercial solution and expensive and provisioning ine at the present moment is a time intensive process. What is needed is the ability to generate a customizable cyber range with IT/OT components to support both the training and the mission of Coast Guard Cyber Command._

__Objectives:__

*  Research the best methodolofy to meet this need (IT & OT) and design appropriate system (computer and network) architecture
*  Implement a solution including necessary monitoring and scoring
*  Demonstrate successful completion with the CGA Cyber Team.

Files & Directory Structure
------------------------------

The following is a list and short description of the content you may find in this repository.

* [`00_colors.sh`](00_colors.sh)

    This is a simple convenience script to declare some colors, for configuration scripts. The usage should be a simple `. ./00_colors.sh` at the top of most scripts.

* [`01_download_homebrew_and_install_git.sh`](01_download_homebrew_and_install_git.sh)
    
    This is the first script you should run on a new machine... assuming that you are deploying on a Mac, which is what we were told the product would be deployed on. It simply downloads and installs `git`.
